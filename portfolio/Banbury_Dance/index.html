                <p><h2>Ballet Classes</h2></p>
                <p>Class structure for all levels is essentially the same, with content based on appropriate developmental skills for the specific age. Each class begins with barre work. At the barre students learn correct posture and placement of the entire body. The exercises in this section also teach balance and promote strength. They include various types of jumps that are the building blocks for the allegro (jumping) steps of classical ballet.

                    <br>
                Following the barre warm-up comes stretching. These gentle exercises progress in difficulty as students gain flexibility.
                Essential concepts such as classroom etiquette, musical awareness, and spatial relationships to other dancers are taught early on. The components of the stage, theatre terminology and pantomime are explored during the year.
                The last portion of class develops the locomotive skills that form the basis for all ballet steps that travel.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                Students participate in a variety of free movement exercises that teach listening skills (responding to the tempo and mood of the music), levels (high, medium, and low), and directions (upstage, downstage, stage right and stage left).</p>

                <p><h2>Tap Dance</h2></p>
                <p>

                Tap dancing is a type of dance which demonstrates various rhythms made by movements of the feet. Metal taps are attached to the shoes to emphasize the sounds. Tap is truly an American style of dance. It develops exactness in rhythm and timing, coordination of the mind and body, ability to think fast and an overall feeling of “dancing” through the relaxation of its style. - from TATD textbook
                 <br>
                 <br>       
                Our Students take Tap combined with their Ballet class. Older students may not always do tap depending upon time of year, upcoming performance, etc.

                <p><h2>Jazz Dance</h2></p>
                <p>Jazz is defined as stylized theatrical dancing based on many other forms of dance and influenced by American Jazz music. It is the predominant form of dance used in the American Musical Theatre and an integral part of the entertainment field. Jazz dance has many titles, but has developed a technique, style and theory all it’s own.
                – from TATD textbook
                    <br>
                    <br>
                Our Students usually begin Jazz at age 10 or older. We feel you must have a strong foundation in ballet before you can learn another style of dance.</p>
