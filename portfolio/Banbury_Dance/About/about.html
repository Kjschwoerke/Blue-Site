                <p><h2>Adult Programs</h2></p>
                <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p>Class structure for all levels is essentially the same, with content based on appropriate developmental skills for the specific age. Each class begins with barre work. At the barre students learn correct posture and placement of the entire body. The exercises in this section also teach balance and promote strength. They include various types of jumps that are the building blocks for the allegro (jumping) steps of classical ballet. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Following the barre warm-up comes stretching. These gentle exercises progress in difficulty as students gain flexibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                Essential concepts such as classroom etiquette, musical awareness, and spatial relationships to other dancers are taught early on. The components of the stage, theatre terminology and pantomime are explored during the year.
                </p>
                <p>    
                The last portion of class develops the locomotive skills that form the basis for all ballet steps that travel.
                </p>
                <p>    
                Students participate in a variety of free movement exercises that teach listening skills (responding to the tempo and mood of the music), levels (high, medium, and low), and directions (upstage, downstage, stage right and stage left).</p>

                <p><h2>Children's Programs</h2></p>
                <div class="paragraph-container">
                <p>Our Early Childhood Program is specially designed to provide children between two and six years of age with a strong foundation in dance. It teaches young dancers the basic elements of movement. Space and how we relate to it. Both as an individual and as a member of a group. Musical rhythm, beat and time; opposites and directions; and some elementary positions of ballet. Integrated with these physical concepts are the intellectual concepts of self-awareness, creative expression, imagination, teamwork, and basic body/health awareness.Through participation in these classes, students also learn the basics of classroom behavior and manners. These concepts remain the same throughout their dancing years and include learning how to take turns, following another dancer or leading the way, waiting patiently, working together with others, and having a positive attitude.</p>
            
                <p>Educators now know that training young children in the concepts of movement, sequencing, patterning, and spatial relationships lays a strong foundation for the later development of reading, mathematics, and other educational skills, all of this adds up to the discipline necessary to be an excellent student in school as well. Children in our Early Childhood Program work actively in all these areas.
